# Project Overview

* Created a model which can classify whether a wine is good (>= 7/10) or bad (< 7/10), with 95% accuracy from the physiochemical properties.
* trained and optimised several models including Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SVC with rbf-kernel, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Built a basic API using Flask

The best models were the Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier
